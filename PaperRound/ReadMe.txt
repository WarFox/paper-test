User Stories
============


Story 1
-------

A town planner is responsible for keeping track of the layout of a feature.street and numbering houses. The layout is stored in a feature.street specification file.
An example is given in street1.txt

The feature.street specification file can be interpreted as follows:
	- The feature.street specification file lists all the house numbers in the feature.street from west to east.
	- House numbering starts from 1
	- All the houses on the left-hand (north) side of the feature.street are odd numbered
	- All the houses on the right-hand (south) side of the feature.street are even numbered
	- For example, a feature.street specification file containing "1 3 2" can be interpreted as there being, from west to east:
		- house #1 on the left-hand (north) side of the feature.street,
		- followed by house #3, also on the left-hand (north) side of the feature.street,
		- followed by house #2 on the right-hand (south) side of the feature.street.
		- (Note: in the real world houses on a feature.street are frequently directly opposite each other. For this purposes of this exercise,
		  this is assumed never to be the case!)
	- On each side of the feature.street no number can be skipped and no number can be used more than once

As a town planner, given a feature.street specification file, I want to display a report showing:

AC1. that the file is valid.
AC2. how many houses there are in a given feature.street
AC3. how many houses are on the left hand (north) side of the feature.street
AC4. how many houses are on the right hand (south) side of the feature.street


Story 2
-------

A paper boy or girl delivers newspapers to all the houses in a given feature.street. They are experimenting with two approaches to delivering papers:
(1) In one approach they first travel from west to east delivering to the houses on the left hand (north) side of the feature.street. They then travel east to
    west delivering to houses on the south side of the feature.street.
(2) In the second approach they deliver to each house in turn from west to east, regardless of which side of the road they are on.

As a newspaper boy or girl given a feature.street, I want to know for both approaches (1) and (2):

AC5. the list of house numbers in the order that I will be delivering to, so that I can sort by satchel in advance
AC6. how many times I will have to cross the road from one side to the other to make my deliveries
